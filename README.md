# cs-499-Enhancement-One

The artifact used was the CS 330: Computational Graphics and Visualization Final Project. The idea for this project was to recreate a 2D scene into a 3D scene using OpenGL. The objects in this scene are made up of basic shapes such as cubes, cylinders, spheres, and planes. This project was created over a few weeks in the CS 330: Computational Graphics and Visualization course.  

I chose this artifact because it represents one of the most complex programs I developed during my time at SNHU. Recognizing its complexity, I identified numerous areas for enhancement. This artifact exemplifies my ability to create collaborative environments through proper commenting and a modular design approach. Such practices ensure that fellow programmers, particularly those acquainted with C++ and OpenGL, can readily comprehend, contribute to, and modify the program. 

In enhancing this artifact, I expanded upon its original design by introducing innovative elements. One significant addition was transforming the platform into a standing desk. This involved integrating legs to support the platform and adding a floor upon which the desk stands. These enhancements not only augment the program's functionality but also demonstrate my capacity for creative problem-solving and ingenuity in design. 

While enhancing this project, I learned even more about how important comments are in code. Without comments, I do not know if I would have been able to figure out what each part of the code did. Luckily, I had comments already in the code to help me understand what each piece of the code was doing. One challenge I faced was getting my legs into the right position. This takes time as you must make an educated guess on the correct x, y, z coordinates to get the legs and the floor in the correct position. Getting over this challenge required some guess and check. I would change the coordinates and check to see if the shape was in the right spot or how much closer it was to the right spot. The camera movements that I already coded into the program helped a lot as I could get closer to the legs to make sure they were perfectly even. 

employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision-making in computer science. 
I achieved this outcome through comprehensive comments, code documentation of changes, and a modular structure that allows any programmer to easily understand and edit the code. I included inline comments to explain enhancements and addressed areas lacking comments. 
Additionally, I provided an overview of each code file's functionality in the header of each file. 

 Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts.  

I achieved this outcome through a comprehensive code review, where I discussed the code and outlined the enhancement plan that was executed. Additionally, I provided comments in adherence to the best computer science practices, highlighting the enhancements made. I also documented the enhancement process with a written narrative. Furthermore, the utilization of DLLs, headers, and other resources developed by others in this project showcases my ability to effectively collaborate and work with peer-created code. 

Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals.  

I achieved this outcome by fulfilling both the enhancement criteria I established and those of the entire project. Throughout the development process, I adhered to the best computer science practices. Additionally, I demonstrated proficiency in utilizing the OpenGL API, Visual Studio IDE, and the C++ coding language. These skills were showcased through the incorporation of additional features into the program, such as the implementation of legs and a floor.
